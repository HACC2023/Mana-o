### About Mālama Honua
Our team name is Manaʻo meaning “thought” or “idea”, as our goal is to gain insight in solving complex real-world problems through software engineering. Our application, Mālama Honua, meaning “to take care of the Earth”, is a responsive web application with multiple levels of user access, allowing for real-time updates on large marine debris reports and the seven steps it takes to dispose or repurpose the trash into useful products. It features a relational database with an easy UI for administrative access and a chat feature that allows for communication between the removal organization staff. Technologies used: React with JWT Authentication, Node.js Express, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap and socket.io for the in-app chat.

### How To
The following is a walk-through guide of Mālama Honua's features.

## Landing Page
Users don't need to sign-up to be able to make an initial debris reporting. This is consistent with the way that marine debris is reported and handled by the DLNR Division of Boating and Ocean Recreation [DOBOR Form](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/dobor/reportmarinedebrishawaii/). From the sponsor's request, we replicated this form - since this is the only existing form that is used to gather initial debris reports.
